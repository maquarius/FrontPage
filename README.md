# About
Basic personal frontpage made with Javascript. It contains all the links that were relevant for my University, so that it was easier to reach them. It also has a small to do list, which saves to the machine locally.
The background changes depending on the time of day. Made with just JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

## Future
I don't plan to continue this project, but i will make a new project with the same idea. I like building a personalised starting page, which containts all the usefull links and information for me. I will start that project somewhere in the summer of 2021.
